# Hi! ;)

## Who I am
My name is Wesley, a 23 years old living in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands.

I've been interested in Computer Science since age 13, when I started creating my first static websites using HTML. Now, 10 years later, I'm doing it for a living.

## What I do

I am currently working at [Mobiel.nl](http://www.mobiel.nl) as a back-end developer.

Started working at [Mobiel.nl](http://www.mobiel.nl) in May 2017, shortly after getting my CS degree. I've previously worked at various small software companies for either a parttime job or an internship during my time at University.

> Debating technical issues and solving complex algorithms is what makes my job awesome.
